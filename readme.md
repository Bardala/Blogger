To use Blogger, you need to register an account or log in with an existing one.

Once logged in, you can create a new post by clicking on the "New Post" button on the navbar. You can delete your own posts by clicking on the corresponding button on the post detail page.

You can also comment on any post by filling out the form at the bottom of the post detail page.

You can use Markdown syntax to format your posts and comments. For example, you can use `**bold**` for bold text, `*italic*` for italic text, `# Heading` for headings, etc. You can find more information about Markdown here: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
