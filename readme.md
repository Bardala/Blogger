## Description

Blogger is an advanced web application designed for creating and sharing blog posts. This new version of Blogger introduces several noteworthy features:

- _Backend Improvement_: The application now utilizes **TypeScript** and **MySQL** instead of JavaScript and MongoDB for a more stable and reliable backend.
- _Class Components_: The codebase has been refactored to follow the object-oriented programming paradigm, replacing functional components with class components.
- _Typed APIs_: **TypeScript** and **Express.js** have been employed to design and implement typed APIs, ensuring type safety and improved error handling.
- _Clean and Maintainable Code_: The codebase adheres to **SOLID principles** and clean code practices, prioritizing readability, maintainability, and testability.
- _Design Patterns_: Notable design patterns, such as the **DAO** and **Singleton** patterns, have been applied to abstract data access logic and object creation logic. This enhances code reusability and improves readability.

These updates result in an enhanced Blogger application, providing improved stability, efficiency, and overall user experience. **TypeScript** brings strong typing to the application, ensuring better type safety and reducing runtime errors. By utilizing **MySQL**, the backend becomes more robust and reliable, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval. The use of **class components** and design patterns like **DAO** and **Singleton** improves code organization, reusability, and maintainability. Additionally, the implementation of typed APIs using **TypeScript** and **Express.js** enhances error handling and improves the overall development experience. These advancements contribute to a more stable, efficient, and user-friendly blogging platform.
